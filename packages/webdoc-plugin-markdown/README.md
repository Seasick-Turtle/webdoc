# @webdoc/plugin-markdown

This plugin will replace markdown syntax in your document descriptions with HTML markup. You don't need to explicity install this plugin because @webdoc/cli has a dependency on it.

## Usage

In your `webdoc.conf.json` file, add `plugins/markdown` to your `plugins` entry:

```js
{
  plugins: ["plugins/markdown"]
}
```
